# hacks
here we're trying to re-write [tomnomnom hacks](https://github.com/tomnomnom/hacks) in Rust :crab:
because of two reasons

1. to fix/improve some of tomnomnom tools
2. take it as an example for cybersecurity community who's trying to learn How to create tools in Rust


## installation
install rust first from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
then replace the TOOL_NAME word in this command with the folder name of the tool you want to install
```bash
$ cargo install --git="https://github.com/knassar702/hacks" TOOL_NAME
```
